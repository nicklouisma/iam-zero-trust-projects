# Identity-First Zero Trust & IAM Architecture Portfolio
A portfolio of hands-on IAM and Zero Trust architecture projects demonstrating identity governance, privileged access, cloud IAM security, and threat-informed access control design.

This repo is a personal security architecture portfolio focused on identity-first Zero Trust and Identity & Access Management (IAM) design. It showcases how I design, evaluate, and operationalize access controls across users, devices, apps, workloads, and privileged systems. I focus on threat-driven decision-making, least privilege, continuous verification, and auditability rather than point-in-time access. 

I will demonstrate the following:
- Identity-first Zero Trust architecture and policy decision flows
- Privileged access design using just-in-time (JIT) elevation
- Identity governance and access review models aligned with SOC2 / SOX
- Secure OAuth/OIDC and SAML authentication patterns
- Cloud IAM threat modeling and privilege escalation prevention
- Security metrics used to measure Zero Trust maturity

## Technologies & Concepts Referenced

## Sanitization Notice

All architectures, workflows, and examples are intentionally generalized.
No proprietary systems, internal configurations, or employer-specific data
are included. Any resemblance to real environments is conceptual only.
